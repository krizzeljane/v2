							<p class="text-white">We are now in an era where franchise dealership margins are getting squeezed by both the internet and big auction houses. CARWAVE was founded in 2009 with the mission to use technology to make wholesaling your cars easier and more affordable.
							<br>
							CARWAVE is more affordable than traditional auctions. There are NO sell fees, NO inspection fees, NO shipping fees when selling your trade-ins through CARWAVE. Also with CARWAVE, dealers don’t have to worry about bad run numbers or sabotaged cars, avoiding the hassles of traditional auction houses. 
							<br>
							At CARWAVE, you get more money for your cars! All trade-ins come with detailed condition reports performed by ASE Certified Mechanics. We GUARANTEE our inspections, regardless of year or mileage. This gives our buying dealerships more confidence to pay more for your “As-is” cars.

				<h2 class="p-header">TAKING THE RISK OUT OF THE AUCTION</h2> <br>
				<p>All vehicles listed on CARWAVE include detailed condition reports performed by ASE Certified Mechanics. <br>
				Unlike traditional auctions that sell both "as-is" and "guaranteed" cars, all cars on CARWAVE are guaranteed as described in the inspection report. We stand behind our inspections, regardless of year or mileage, so there are no surprises when the purchased vehicles arrive at the buying dealership. This gives our trusted network of dealers the confidence to sell and buy online. <br>
				Our ASE Certified Mechanic inspectors are dispatched directly to franchise dealerships for a 40-minute inspection per vehicle, then listed directly into our auction. CARWAVE offers the most comprehensive condition reports and the most extensive inspections in the industry.
